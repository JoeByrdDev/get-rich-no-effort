I prompted the AI for SaaS ideas, specifically targeting researched market weaknesses. The AI today is as good as it's ever been, let's see if anything it says makes sense. It can even try to defend it's ideas lol

So, it's ideas are:
1. AI website accessibility helper
2. Trade School LMS (Learning Management System)
3. Microbrewery Supply Chain
4. Pet Groomer Platform (REJECTED)
5. Cannabis Compliance
6. Elder Care Coordination
7. Freelancer Insurance 
8. Farm-to-Table Network
9. Subscription Box Ops

Can't do Pet Groomer Platform, so that one is out.
